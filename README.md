# COSMOS-2015-Final-Project
My final project for the COSMOS 2015 Math Cluster at UC Davis was about Fermat's Little Theorem and its applications to encryption method RSA. In order to supplement my project, I created two simulation programs - one for the encryption process itself and the other to mock-hack a smaller version of RSA. Both programs are extensively commented and formatted to be readable.
